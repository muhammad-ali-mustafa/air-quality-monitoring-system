# Air Quality Monitoring System using ESP8266

This project was developed by **Muhammad Ali Mustafa**,  
BE Mechatronics Engineering graduate from the College of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering (CEME), NUST.

## Project Overview
This project monitors environmental air quality parameters including temperature, humidity, air quality index (AQI), and estimated oxygen level. The system uses an ESP8266 NodeMCU to send real-time data to the Blynk IoT platform and display readings on an I2C LCD.

## Features
- Real-time air quality monitoring
- Temperature and humidity sensing using DHT22
- Gas level measurement using MQ135
- Oxygen level estimation
- IoT-based monitoring using Blynk
- LCD display with alternating data views
- Pollution alert notifications

## Hardware Used
- ESP8266 NodeMCU
- DHT22 Temperature & Humidity Sensor
- MQ135 Gas Sensor
- I2C 16x2 LCD
- LED Indicator

## Software Used
- Arduino IDE
- Blynk IoT Platform
- Embedded C/C++
